## What is this?
This is the Shimakaze repository, home to all of the main logic behind the Shimakaze mod loader, as well as all the functionality and standards that come with it. At the time of writing this, it is not in a usable state to create a Geometry Dash mod with; but progress is steady.

Currently, the Shimakaze project houses and is built off of the unfinished variant of v8 10.5, which has yet to be released at the time of writing this.

**Primarily, we hope to include in this loader to**:

* Expose the functionalities of Geometry Dash and cocos2d-x in a way that allows the ease of modification and access to aspects of modding that are difficult to access, or require upper knowledge to access;
* Add and modify essential features, such as events, standard libraries, and other useful tools to make modding easier and simplified;
* Give users an easy way of hooking Geometry Dash & cocos2d-x APIs, and allow interoperability between mods where useful;
* Comprehensively manage mods and ensure developers have ease of access to package and distribute their mods;
* Ship into a single executable library that you can import with common library loaders;
* And create a set of standard and documented modules guaranteed to work with Shimakaze.

While the nature of an interpreter will naturally slow down Geometry Dash, the developers over at Amatsukaze that are tasked with the creation of Shimakaze will do their best to ensure the utmost performance and speed within the interoperabiliy between Geometry Dash, and Shimakaze itself.

### Why make Shimakaze?

Shimakaze is designed to be easy for anyone- even a beginner -to have an easy way of handling and creating mods for Geometry Dash. Unlike other common mod loaders, headers, SDKs, and more; we aim to allow developers to have an easy way of distributing and creating mods in a language very familliar to most people who are programmers.

Even if we fail as a mod loader, we hope to provide other useful tools for modders to distribute their mods, and other Geometry Dash assts.

## Getting Started
Currently, there is no way to utilize Shimakaze, as it is not in a state of usability. You are allowed to witness it's development

## Development
The development of Shimakaze is a complicated process, due to the nature of how the v8 library is compiled. You will be required to have all the tools necessary for utilizing it, as well as a comprehensive and wide range of knowledge regarding the library itself. Aid on how to compile v8 if necessary will be provided.

### Requirements
* v8 10.5 (candidate)

....Currently, I myself am not sure what is necessary for compiling Shimakaze.
I will edit this later when I figure that out.

## Contributions
All contributions are fully appreciated, and we will have in depth guide on how to contribute, as well as how to test and improve Shimakaze at a whole. At baseline, the help we appreciate correlates to developing the library, as well as its standards, and the manuals for its usage. All contributions shall be done over issue with an associated pull request if necessary.

For all ideas, suggestions and other forms of similar discussion correlating to Shimakaze, we ask you to use our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BK6gBaKr8N).

### Licensing
Shimakaze uses the **GNU A-GPL v3.0 License**, which allows you to distribute and even privately copy our codebase, but leaves all the liabilities to you. It also requires you to state any change you make to the codebase, and utilize the same license if you do end up using any of our code in your works.

That's a small synopsis, and to get the full picture of what is and isn't allowed; it's best for you to view the [license file](https://github.com/amatsukaze-ml/shimakaze/blob/master/LICENSE) on your own. Github provides a neat synopsis at base, which is helpful.
